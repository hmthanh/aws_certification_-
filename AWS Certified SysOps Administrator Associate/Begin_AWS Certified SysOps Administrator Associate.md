# AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate

# Exam 1

### Question 1:
A retail company wants to get out of the business of owning and maintaining its own IT infrastructure. As part of this digital transformation, the company wants to archive about 5PB of data in its on-premises data center to durable long term storage.
* Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into AWS Glacier
* Setup AWS direct connect between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud. Use this connection to transfer the data into AWS Glacier
* Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to transition the data into AWS Glacier
* Setup Site-to-Site VPN connection between the on-premises data center and AWS Cloud. Use this connection to transfer the data into AWS Glacier

### Question 2:
A systems administrator has configured Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for two separate development teams. However, only one configuration has CloudWatch agent installed on the instances, whereas the other one does not have it. The administrator has not manually installed the agents on either group of instances.
* CloudWatch agent can be configured to be loaded on the EC2 instances while configuring the ASG. The developer could have unintentionally checked this flag on one of the ASGs he created
* The instance architecture might not have been compatible with the AMI chosen. The incompatibility results in various errors, one of which is, some of the AWS services will not be installed as expected
* If your AMI contains a CloudWatch agent, itâ€™s automatically installed on EC2 instances when you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. The developer needs to choose the AMI that has CloudWatch agent pre-configured on it
* The architecture of the InstanceType mentioned in your launch configuration does not match the image architecture. So, the ASG was created with errors, resulting in skipping CloudWatch agent. A thorough check is needed for such ASGs, more services could have been skipped

### Question 3:
An e-commerce company relies heavily on the AWS Systems Manager for automating various management tasks for the fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that host their applications.
* Automatic recovery of impaired instances is not possible currently
* Use the AWS-UpdateCloudFormationStackWithApproval document to update impaired instances
* Use the AWS-UpdateWindowsAmi document to recover impaired instances
* Use the AWSSupport-ExecuteEC2Rescue document to recover impaired instances

### Question 4:
A company initially used a manual process to create and manage different IAM roles needed for the organization. As the company expanded and lines of business grew, different AWS accounts were created to manage the AWS resources as well as the users. The manual process has resulted in errors with IAM roles getting created with insufficient permissions. The company is looking at automating the process of creating and managing the necessary IAM roles for multiple AWS accounts. The company already uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts.
* Use AWS Directory Service with AWS Organizations to automatically associate necessary IAM roles with the Microsoft Active Directory users
* Create CloudFormation templates and reuse them to create necessary IAM roles in each of the AWS accounts
* Use CloudFormation StackSets with AWS Organizations to deploy and manage IAM roles to multiple AWS accounts simultaneously
* Use AWS Resource Access Manager that integrates with AWS Organizations to deploy and manage shared resources across AWS accounts

### Question 5:
An hour after launching an important feature on its website, an analytics company has realized that an important page has issues that need to be addressed. The web application is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance with CloudFront being used to reduce latency for the users. Few users have already accessed this page and the company wants to pull it down as soon as possible.
* Specify a default root object to show only this object and not the faulty web page
* By default, CloudFront caches files in edge locations for 24 hours. So, it's not possible to remove the file before this time
* Use CloudFront policies to control what the users can see
* Invalidate the file from CloudFront distribution so that the file is removed immediately

### Question 6:
A university has just registered for an AWS account to help provide the necessary cloud infrastructure for the students planning to implement a Big Data analytics workflow as part of their thesis. The university has hired you to set up this infrastructure and help their technology team understand the basics of the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* By default, all subnets can route between each other, whether they are private or public
* When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block
* Subnets, like VPCs, can span across Availability Zones, but will remain in a single AWS Region
* Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the subnet is always private
* A private subnet, by default, does not have inbound data traffic from the internet. You create a route to the Internet Gateway in the subnet route table to allow access to the private subnet
* If a subnet has a route to an internet gateway, along with traffic that can be routed to a virtual private gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet

### Question 7:
The technology team at a retail company has set the DisableApiTermination attribute for a business-critical Amazon EC2 Windows instance to prevent termination of the instance via an API. This instance is behind an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and the InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior attribute is set for the instance. A developer has initiated shutdown from the instance using operating system commands.
* The instance will be terminated
* The operating system of the instance will send an Amazon SNS notification to the concerned person, that was configured when DisableApiTermination attribute was set. The operating system will hold the shutdown for few configured minutes and then progress with instance shutdown
* ASG cannot terminate an instance whose DisableApiTermination attribute is set
* The instance will not shutdown because DisableApiTermination attribute is set

### Question 8:
Multiple teams of an e-commerce company use the same AWS CloudFormation template to create stacks of resources needed by them. For the next deployment, the teams need to update the stacks and have been testing the changes through change sets. However, the teams suddenly realized that all their change sets have been lost. Unable to figure out the error they have approached you.
* An invalid change set was executed and this resulted in all stacks and change sets getting deleted
* CloudFormation had issued a rollback on the change sets while validating them and deleted all the invalid sets
* The change set while being validated, surpassed the account limit of some AWS resource. Since the stacks cannot be updated when the account limit is reached, the change sets have been deleted by CloudFormation
* A change set was successfully executed and this resulted in rest of the change sets being deleted by CloudFormation

### Question 9:
A data analytics company has its server infrastructure built on Amazon EC2 instances fronted with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs). The ELBs are maintained in two AZs with each ELB having two EC2 instances registered with it. Both the instances in one AZ have been recorded as unhealthy.
* HTTP 503: Service unavailable will be received as response
* The Load Balancer routes requests to the unhealthy targets
* HTTP 403: Forbidden will be returned
* The Load Balancer will display an `unhealthy' status and will not accept any incoming requests

### Question 10:
As part of the ongoing system maintenance, a SysOps Administrator has decided to increase the storage capacity of an EBS volume that is attached to an Amazon EC2 instance. However, the increased size is not reflected in the file system.
* EBS volume needs to be detached and attached back again to the instance for the modifications to show
* After you increase the size of an EBS volume, you must extend the file system to a larger size
* Linux servers automatically pick the modifications done to EBS volumes, but Windows servers do not offer this feature. Use the Windows Disk Management utility to increase the disk size to the new modified volume size
* EBS volume might be encrypted. Encrypted EBS volumes will not show modifications done when still attached to the instance. Detach the EBS volume and attach it back

### Question 11:
A retail company has built its server infrastructure on Amazon EC2 instances that run on Windows OS. The development team has defined a few custom metrics that need to be collected by the unified CloudWatch agent.
* Configure the CloudWatch agent with StatsD protocol to collect the necessary system metrics
* CloudWatch agent can be configured with either StatsD protocol or collectd protocol to collect the necessary system metrics on windows servers
* Unified CloudWatch agent cannot be custom configured
* Configure the CloudWatch agent with collectd protocol to collect the necessary system metrics

### Question 12:
An e-commerce company uses AWS Elastic Beanstalk to create test environments comprising of an Amazon EC2 instance and an RDS instance whenever a new product or line-of-service is launched. The company is currently testing one such environment but wants to decouple the database from the environment to run some analysis and reports later in another environment. Since testing is in progress for a high-stakes product, the company wants to avoid downtime and database sync issues.
* Use an Elastic Beanstalk blue (environment A)/green (environment B) deployment to decouple the RDS DB instance from environment A. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment (environment B) with the necessary information to connect to the decoupled RDS DB instance
* Since it is a test environment, take a snapshot of the database and terminate the current environment. Create a new one without attaching an RDS instance directly to it (from the snapshot)
* Decoupling an RDS instance that is part of a running Elastic Beanstalk environment is not currently supported by AWS. You will need to terminate the current environment after taking the snapshot of the database and create a new one with RDS configured outside the environment
* Use an Elastic Beanstalk Immutable deployment to make the entire architecture completely reliable. You can terminate the first environment whenever you are confident of the second environment working correctly

### Question 13:
A developer has configured inbound traffic for the relevant ports in both the Security Group of the EC2 instance as well as the Network Access Control List (NACL) of the subnet for the EC2 instance. The developer is, however, unable to connect to the service running on the Amazon EC2 instance.
* Network ACLs are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Security Groups are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic
* Security Groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic
* IAM Role defined in the Security Group is different from the IAM Role that is given access in the Network ACLs
* Rules associated with Network ACLs should never be modified from command line. An attempt to modify rules from command line blocks the rule and results in an erratic behavior

### Question 14:
A small financial services startup uses Amazon EC2 instance for their server infrastructure and Amazon S3 for storage. The files stored on S3 are critical for the business and the company wants to track access to the buckets for audit and security purposes. The startup is looking at a cost-effective way of doing this without incurring extra costs.
* Use Amazon Inspector, a security assessment service that helps track the calls made to AWS services configured with it
* Use AWS CloudTrail to identify the requests made to the Amazon S3 buckets
* Enable Amazon S3 Server Access Logging for all the buckets that the company deems important and store these logs in another S3 bucket for analysis
* Use AWS X-Ray for tracing Amazon S3 requests from end-to-end

### Question 15:
A retail company stores its business-critical files on an Amazon S3 bucket that is also configured as a website endpoint. The company needs a robust configuration that will allow access only through CloudFront. No user or team member should be able to access the files directly from Amazon S3 URL.
* Setup the Amazon S3 bucket as a custom origin with CloudFront. Restrict the access to content by setting up custom headers
* Configure a Network Access Control List (ACL) with CloudFront to restrict access to users
* Create an Origin Access Identity (OAI) and configure S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket
* Configure a Security Group with CloudFront to restrict access to users

### Question 16:
An automobile company manages its AWS resource creation and maintenance process through AWS CloudFormation. The company has successfully used CloudFormation so far, and wishes to continue using the service. However, while moving to CloudFormation, the company only moved critical resources and left out the other resources to be managed manually. To leverage the ease of creation and maintenance that CloudFormation offers, the company wants to move rest of the resources to CloudFormation.
* Drift detection is the mechanism by which you add resources to the stack of Cloudformation resources already created
* Use Parameters section of CloudFormation template to input the required resources
* You can use Mappings part of CloudFormation template to input the needed resources
* You can bring an existing resource into AWS CloudFormation management using resource import

### Question 17:
A retail company is working on moving their technology infrastructure to AWS Cloud. The company has developed several custom scripts to monitor the instances hosting their applications and want to reuse these scripts on AWS Cloud. The development team is looking at a way to disable the pre-existing Amazon EC2 status checks.
* Status checks are built into Amazon EC2, so they cannot be disabled or deleted
* Amazon EC2 status checks are interwoven into CloudWatch metrics. You can disable EC2 instance status checks from the CloudWatch metrics console
* Amazon EC2 automated checks to identify hardware issues cannot be disabled. Automated checks for software issues can however be disabled
* Status checks are built into Amazon EC2, so they cannot be disabled, but can be deleted from active configuration

### Question 18:
A large IT company manages several projects on AWS Cloud and has decided to use AWS X-Ray to trace application workflows. The company uses a plethora of AWS services like API Gateway, Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 storage service, Elastic Load Balancers and AWS Lambda functions.
* Application Load balancers do not send data to X-Ray
* You cannot use X-Ray to trace or analyze user requests to your Amazon API Gateway APIs
* AWS X-Ray does not integrate with Amazon S3 and you need to use CloudTrail for tracking requests on S3
* AWS X-Ray cannot be used to trace your AWS Lambda functions since they are not integrated

### Question 19:
A retail company has realized that their Amazon EBS volume backed EC2 instance is consistently over-utilized and needs an upgrade. A developer has connected with you to understand the key parameters to be considered when changing the instance type.
* The new instance retains its pubic, private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses that were associated with the old instance
* Resizing of an instance is possible if the root device is either EBS volume or an instance store volume. However, instance store volumes taking longer to start on the new instance, since cache data is lost on these instances
* You must stop your Amazon EBSâ€“backed instance before you can change its instance type. AWS moves the instance to new hardware; however, the instance ID does not change
* There is no downtime on the instance if you choose an instance of a compatible type since AWS starts the new instance and shifts the applications from current instance
* If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service marks the stopped instance as unhealthy, and may terminate it and launch a replacement instance
* Resizing of an instance is only possible if the root device for your instance is an EBS volume

### Question 20:
A production-ready application has just been deployed to Amazon EC2 instance that uses MySQL RDS as the database. The team is looking at making the RDS deployment highly available and failure-proof.
* Scale up your DB instance when you are approaching storage capacity limits
* Configure your JVM with a TTL value of no more than 60 seconds, to help you re-establish the connection to your database, in case of failure
* Configure the RDS to be a multi Availability Zone (AZ) deployment
* Configure automated backups for the RDS instance, to retrieve data and instance status, if needed after a failure

### Question 21:
A multi-national company extensively uses AWS CloudFormation to model and provision its AWS resources. A human error had earlier deleted a critical service from the CloudFormation stack that resulted in business loss. The company is looking at a quick and effective solution to lock the critical resources from any updates or deletes.
* Use nested stacks that will retain the configuration in the parent configuration even if the child configuration is lost or cannot be used
* Use Stack policies to protect critical stack resources from unintentional updates
* Use parameter constraints to specify the Identities that can update the Stack
* Use revision controls to protect critical stack resources from unintentional updates

### Question 22:
A healthcare company aggregates the daily data via a nightly batch job that runs for two hours and then sends the output to downstream applications. Currently, this job is run on On-Demand instances. The company is looking at reducing costs for this job since it is not critical to business and the job can be re-initiated if it fails.
* Opt for Spot instances
* Purchase reserved instances that offer instances at high discounts
* Use a combination of On-Demand and Reserved instances to reduce cost while keeping a minimum capacity to run without interruption
* Opt for Spot block instances

### Question 23:
As a SysOps Administrator, you have been contacted by a team for troubleshooting a security issue they seem to be facing. A security check red flag is being raised for the security groups created by AWS Directory Services. The flag message says "Security Groups - Unrestricted Access."
* AWS Directory Service might have been initiated from an account that does not have proper permissions. Check the permissions on the IAM roles and IAM users used to initiate the service
* Ignore or suppress the red flag since it is safe to do so, in this scenario
* The security group configurations have to be checked and edited to cater to AWS security standards
* Use AWS Trusted Advisor to know the exact reason for this error and take action as recommended by the Trusted Advisor

### Question 24:
A company has recently moved its server infrastructure to Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs to use CloudWatch metrics to track the state of each of the instances.
* Configure CloudWatch from AWS Console for the instances that need to be monitored by CloudWatch. AWS automatically installs and configure the agent for the mentioned instances
* Install CloudWatch Agent on all the instances and attach an IAM role to the EC2 instances to be able to run the CloudWatch agent
* Install CloudWatch Agent on all the instances and attach an IAM user to the EC2 instances to be able to run the CloudWatch agent
* Install CloudWatch Agent on all the instances and attach necessary Security Groups to the EC2 instances to be able to run the CloudWatch agent

### Question 25:
A systems administration team is configuring Amazon EC2 metrics that are sent to Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring purposes. The team is looking for a metric that can help them identify the processing power required to run an application on the selected instance.
* CPUCreditUsage metric should be used to identify the processing power required
* CPUUtilization metric should be used to identify the processing power required
* ResourceCount is the correct metric to identify the processing power required
* CPUProcessPower metric should be used to identify the processing power required

### Question 26:
An e-commerce company runs its web application on Amazon EC2 instances backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. An Amazon S3 bucket is used for storing sharable data. A developer has attached an Amazon EBS to an Amazon EC2 instance, but itâ€™s still in the "attaching" state after 10-15 minutes.
* The attaching status indicates that the underlying hardware related to your EBS volume has failed. This issue cannot be fixed. Raise a service request on AWS and request for a new volume. You are not charged for volumes that are in error state
* The EBS volume could be encrypted and the custom KMS key used to encrypt the snapshot is missing. The custom KMS key needs to be added to the volume configuration
* Check that the device name you specified when you attempted to attach the EBS volume isn't already in use. Attempt to attach the volume to the instance, again, but use a different device name
* Each EBS volume receives an initial I/O credit balance, an error in accumulating the credit balance can stop the volume from attaching properly to the instance. Restart the instance to fix the error

### Question 27:
While checking different deployment options, a development team has realized that there is a significant increase in latency when data on a new EBS volume (created from a snapshot) is accessed for the first time. This seems to be the general behavior of all the EBS volumes used by Amazon EC2 instances for different applications.
* Initialize the EBS volume or pre-warm it before moving the volumes to production
* Use an Amazon EBSâ€“optimized instance
* Use RAID 0 to maximize utilization of instance resources
* Increase read-ahead for high-throughput, read-heavy workloads on st1 and sc1

### Question 28:
A financial services company runs a flagship application that hosts critical data for several clients. The company uses AWS CloudTrail to track user activities on various AWS resources. An audit firm has raised several security-specific questions about the CloudTrail logs. The company is looking at ways to secure these logs from being tampered.
* Use Amazon S3 MFA Delete to know the delete operations performed by any user on the logs stored in S3 buckets
* Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep all versions of the file created
* Use CloudTrail log file integrity to keep the logs tamper-proof
* Use KMS logfile security keys to keep the CloudTrail logs secure and tamper-proof

### Question 29:
A firm uses Amazon EC2 instances for running its flagship application. With new business expansion plans, the firm is looking at a bigger footprint for its AWS infrastructure. The development team needs to share Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) across AZs, AWS accounts and Regions.
* You do not need to share the Amazon EBS snapshots that an AMI references in order to share the AMI
* You can only share AMIs that have unencrypted volumes and volumes that are encrypted with an AWS-managed CMK
* You can only share AMIs that have unencrypted volumes and volumes that are encrypted with a customer-managed CMK
* AMIs are regional resources and can be shared across Regions
* You need to share any CMKs used to encrypt snapshots and any Amazon EBS snapshots that the AMI references

### Question 30:
A junior developer working on configuring CloudWatch alarms is unable to figure out why a particular CloudWatch Alarm is constantly in the ALARM state.
* Custom alarms once triggered remain in Alarm state till they are manually disabled from either the AWS Console or through application code
* CloudWatch alarm has been incorrectly configured and needs to be deleted and re-configured for fixing the persistent error
* Once an alarm is triggered and an action is performed, the application logic has to reset the alarm to its normal state. This code has to be included by the development team
* Alarms continue to evaluate metrics against the configured threshold, even after they have already triggered. You can adjust the alarm threshold if you do not want it to be in ALARM state

### Question 31:
A digital marketing company that manages customer data for its clients has seen a spike in traffic that seems to be malicious. The traffic is served via Amazon CloudFront service. The company wants to set up strong security to keep their server instances and databases secure and also be able to replicate the same security processes across multiple AWS accounts that the company holds.
* Configure Security Groups on CloudFront to deny access to IP addresses that seem to send the malicious traffic. The Security Group settings can be exported out to another AWS account for easy replication
* Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) on CloudFront to keep the AWS infrastructure safe from malicious attacks. Use AWS Firewall Manager to replicate and manage the WAF configurations across AWS accounts
* Configure AWS Firewall Manager to create a secure barrier on CloudFront. Settings can be replicated across accounts by manually exporting the Firewall Manager configuration
* Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Amazon EC2 instances to keep the instances as well as the databases safe. WAF configured on CloudFront increases latency for users accessing the application. WAF configuration can be replicated using CloudFormation templates

### Question 32:
A video streaming app uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for streaming data. The systems administration team needs to be informed of the shard capacity when it is reaching its limits.
* Configure Amazon CloudWatch Events to pick data from Amazon Inspector
* Use CloudWatch ServiceLens to monitor data on service limits of various AWS services
* Configure Amazon CloudTrail to generate logs for the service limits. CloudTrail and CloudWatch are integrated and hence alarm can be generated for customized service checks
* Monitor Trusted Advisor service check results with Amazon CloudWatch Events

### Question 33:
Your company has decided that certain users should have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled for their sign-in credentials. A newly hired manager has a Gemalto MFA device that he used in his earlier company. He has approached you to configure it for his AWS account.
* AWS MFA relies on knowing a unique secret associated with your hardware MFA. This has to be generated again with AWS MFA for the Gemalto device to work with AWS
* AWS MFA does not support the use of your existing Gemalto device
* You can re-use an existing Gemalto device with AWS MFA, as Gemalto devices do not share any secrets between multiple parties
* Security constraints mandate that sharing of secrets between multiple parties can only happen in edge cases. Hence, formal approval is needed between AWS and the previous company to use the same Gemalto device

### Question 34:
A media company stores all their articles on Amazon S3 buckets. As a security measure, they have server access logging enabled for all the buckets. The company is looking at a solution that can regularly check if logging is enabled for all the existing buckets and for any new ones they create. If the solution can also automate the remedy, it will be a perfect fit for their requirement.
* Use AWS Config rules to check whether or not an S3 bucket has logging enabled, and carry out the necessary remediation if needed
* Enable AWS CloudTrail to track the logging information for all the S3 buckets. Currently, AWS does not provide an automatic remediation process, hence, use a Lambda function to rectify any aberrations found during the checks
* Create a Lambda function that will check the logging status of all the S3 buckets and raise an Amazon SNS notification, if a remedy is needed
* Amazon S3 server access logging is checked by AWS Trusted Advisor, as part of the best practices check it performs. Configure a remedy action with Trusted Advisor for all the resources that fails this best practice check

### Question 35:
A junior systems administrator has created read replicas for Amazon Aurora for MYSQL. The created read replicas are running into errors consistently.
* Statements containing non-deterministic functions like SYSDATE() should be predefined in the configuration to successfully create the read replica
* Though read replicas can work on both transactional and nontransactional storage engines, nontransactional engines are error-prone because of the way memory is managed on these engines
* Writing to tables on a read replica can break the replication
* To safely write to tables on a read replica, create indexes on the table after setting the read_only parameter to 0
* If the value for the max_allowed_packet parameter for a read replica is less than the max_allowed_packet parameter for the source DB instance, replica errors occur

### Question 36:
A developer has created rules for different events on Amazon EventBridge with AWS Lambda function as a target. The developer has also created an IAM Role with the necessary permissions and associated it with the rule. The rule however is failing, and on initial analysis, it is clear that the IAM Role associated with the rule is not being used when calling the Lambda function.
* AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should not be used to add permissions to EventBridge targets
* The IAM Role is wrongly configured. Delete the existing Role and recreate with necessary permissions and associate the newly created Role with the EventBridge rule
* For Lambda functions configured as a target to EventBridge, you need to provide resource-based policy. IAM Roles will not work
* For Lambda, EventBridge relies on Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define permissions. IAM Roles will not work for Lambda when configured as a target for an EventBridge rule

### Question 37:
A development team has configured its AWS VPC with one public and one private subnet. The public subnet has an Amazon EC2 instance that hosts the application. The private subnet has the RDS database that the application needs to communicate with.
* Configure a VPC peering for enabling communication between the subnets
* Create a Security Group that allows connection from different subnets inside a VPC
* Subnets inside a VPC can communicate with each other without the need for any further configuration. Hence, no additional configurations are needed
* Elastic IP can be configured to initiate communication between private and public subnets

### Question 38:
The development team at a retail company manages the deployment and scaling of their web application through AWS Elastic Beanstalk. After configuring the Elastic Beanstalk environment, the team has realized that Beanstalk is not handling the scaling activities the way they expected. This has impacted the application's ability to respond to the variations in traffic.
* The Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment uses the number of logged-in users, as the criteria to trigger auto-scaling action. These alarms must be configured based on the parameters appropriate for your application
* The IAM Role attached to the Auto Scaling group might not have enough permissions to scale instances on-demand
* By default, Auto Scaling group created from Beanstalk uses Elastic Load Balancing health checks. Configure the Beanstalk to use Amazon EC2 status checks
* The Auto Scaling group in your Elastic Beanstalk environment uses two default Amazon CloudWatch alarms to trigger scaling operations. These alarms must be configured based on the parameters appropriate for your application

### Question 39:
After configuring Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, a systems administrator had tried to launch the Auto Scaling Group. But, the following launch failure message was displayed - Client.InternalError: Client error on launch.
* Your cluster placement group contains an invalid instance type
* The security group specified in your launch configuration might have been deleted
* This error can be caused when an Auto Scaling group attempts to launch an instance that has an encrypted EBS volume, but the service-linked role does not have access to the customer-managed CMK used to encrypt it
* The block device mappings in your launch configuration might contain block device names that are not available or currently not supported

### Question 40:
A startup has reserved On-Demand Capacity Reservations for the Amazon EC2 instances they use for running analytics. Once the billing report was generated, the company was surprised to see that the costs were much higher than expected. The startup has hired you as a SysOps Administrator to bridge this knowledge gap.
* Capacity Reservations do not offer any billing discounts
* Capacity Reservations can be used with Dedicated Hosts, however, they can't be used with placement groups
* On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration
* Capacity Reservations are transferable from one AWS account to another
* On-Demand Capacity Reservations require a fixed one-year or three-year commitment

### Question 41:
A junior developer created multiple stacks of resources in different AWS Regions per the CloudFormation template given to him. The development team soon started having issues with the created resources and their behavior. Initial checks have confirmed that some resources were created and some omitted, though the same template has been used. As a SysOps Administrator, you have been tasked to resolve these issues.
* Insufficient IAM permissions can lead to issues. When you work with an AWS CloudFormation stack, you not only need permissions to use AWS CloudFormation, you must also have permission to use the underlying services that are described in your template
* There might have been dependency errors, that resulted in the stack not being created completely
* The CloudFormation template was created using use-once only option and is not supposed to be reused for creating other stacks
* The CloudFormation template might have custom named IAM resources that are responsible for the unintended behavior

### Question 42:
An IT company runs its server infrastructure on Amazon EC2 instances configured in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) fronted by an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). For ease of deployment and flexibility in scaling, this AWS architecture is maintained via an Elastic Beanstalk environment. The Technology Lead of a project has requested to automate the replacement of unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances in the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
* To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from EC2 to ELB by using a configuration file of your Beanstalk environment
* Modify the Auto Scaling Group from Amazon EC2 console directly to change the health check type to ELB
* Modify the Auto Scaling Group from Amazon EC2 console directly to change the health check type to EC2
* To automate the replacement of unhealthy EC2 instances, you must change the health check type of your instance's Auto Scaling group from ELB to EC2 by using a configuration file of your Beanstalk environment

### Question 43:
A financial analytics company stores their confidential reports in an Amazon S3 bucket. These reports are no more valid or useful for the company after 5 years. Manual deletion is often delayed which results in higher storage costs for the company.
* Use S3 replication to replicate the latest data to another bucket and delete the entire bucket
* Disable versioning on the S3 bucket for which the retention period is being set, to avoid creating retention periods for all versions of the object. Then, configure the retention period in the object lock settings to 5 years
* Configure the "Retain Until Date" in the object lock settings to a date that is 5 years away from the current date
* Configure the Amazon S3 bucket default settings to specify the "Retain Until Date" for all the objects in the bucket

### Question 44:
The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of a healthcare company realized that he does not have access to an Amazon S3 bucket present in the company's own AWS account. The CTO is the root user for the AWS account and has created other AWS users using the root user account.
* Root user always has access to all the resources of the account. The Amazon S3 bucket could be from another AWS account and the S3 bucket has been shared with the root user and hence appears in his list of S3 buckets
* An Amazon S3 bucket policy that specifies a wildcard (*) in the principal element, sometimes is declared void by AWS to avoid the risk of complete public exposure. Such S3 buckets policies are in invalid status and have random behavior
* If an IAM user, with full access to IAM and Amazon S3, assigns a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 bucket and doesn't specify the AWS account root user as a principal, the root user is denied access to that bucket
* Root user has access to all the resources in his AWS account. Contact AWS support to resolve the access issue

### Question 45:
An automobile company uses a hybrid environment to run its technology infrastructure using a mix of on-premises instances and AWS Cloud. The company has a few managed instances in Amazon VPC. The company wants to avoid using the internet for accessing AWS Systems Manager APIs from this VPC.
* You can privately access AWS Systems Manager APIs from Amazon VPC by creating Internet Gateway
* You can privately access AWS Systems Manager APIs from Amazon VPC by creating VPC Endpoint
* You can privately access AWS Systems Manager APIs from Amazon VPC by creating NAT gateway
* You can privately access AWS Systems Manager APIs from Amazon VPC by creating VPN connection

### Question 46:
AWS Shared Responsibility Model discusses the responsibilities that customers and AWS share for different services and resources.
* Managing the data present in S3 Buckets
* Defining rules to move data across different S3 storage classes

### Question 47:
A highly critical financial services application is being moved to AWS Cloud from the on-premises data center. The application uses a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances provisioned in different geographical areas. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the company needs to understand the communication network used between instances at various locations when they interact using public IP addresses.
* Traffic between two EC2 instances in the same AWS Region stays within the AWS network, even when it goes over public IP addresses
* Traffic between EC2 instances in different AWS Regions stays within the AWS network, if there is an Inter-Region VPC Peering connection between the VPCs where the two instances reside
* Direct Connect is the default way of communication where there is no Inter-Region VPC Peering connection between the VPCs. All traffic between instances will use Direct Connect and does not go over the internet
* Traffic between EC2 instances in different AWS Regions where there is no Inter-Region VPC Peering connection between the VPCs where these instances reside, will use edge locations to communicate without going over the internet
* Traffic between two EC2 instances always stays within the AWS network, even when it goes over public IP addresses by using AWS Global Infrastructure

### Question 48:
A personal care web application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instance in two different Availability Zones (AZs). The application uses Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) for communication. The EC2 instances are placed in private subnets. The instances need Internet access to download software updates twice a month.
* Configure a Carrier gateway, that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet
* Configure an Internet Gateway to allow outbound communication on IPv6 for the instances in the private subnet for your VPC. Public subnets are by default connected to the internet and do not need any extra configuration
* Configure Egress-only Internet Gateway, that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet
* Configure an Internet Gateway to allow outbound communication on IPv6. Associate the IPv6 address to an Elastic IP address to make it public

### Question 49:
As a SysOps Administrator, you maintain the development account of a large team that comprises of both developers and testers. The Development account has two IAM groups: Developers and Testers. Users in both groups have permission to work in the development account and access resources there. From time to time, a developer must update the live S3 Bucket in the production account.
* Use Inline policies to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently assigned to an identity other than the one they're intended for
* Create a Role in Production account, that defines the Development account as a trusted entity and specify a permissions policy that allows trusted users to update the bucket. Developers can use the newly created role to access the live S3 buckets in production environment
* Create a Role in development account, that defines the production account as a trusted entity and specify a permissions policy that allows trusted users to update the bucket. Then, modify the IAM group policy in development account, so that testers are denied access to the newly created role. Developers can use the newly created role to access the live S3 buckets in production environment
* Create a Role in production account, that defines the development account as a trusted entity and specify a permissions policy that allows trusted users to update the bucket. Then, modify the IAM group policy in development account, so that testers are denied access to the newly created role. Developers can use the newly created role to access the live S3 buckets in production environment

* When run from AWS CLI, URL of the website hosted on S3 will be displayed as output

### Question 51:
An e-commerce web application is built on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances with an Auto Scaling Group. The application performance remains consistent throughout the day. But, for a few weeks now, users have been complaining about lagging screens and failing orders between 5-6 PM almost every day. Server logs show a sharp spike in user activity for this one hour every day.
* Configure an Elastic Load Balancer, to replace the ASG, and move all the instances to ELB
* Modify the Auto Scaling Group launch configuration to include more number of instances
* You can choose to manually add few more instances to the ASG to deal with the sudden spike
* Create a scheduled scaling action to scale up before the traffic spike hits the servers

### Question 52:
A healthcare web application has been deployed on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The application worked well in the development and test environments. In production, however, users are getting logged off and are being asked to log in several times in an hour.
* Enable Sticky Sessions on Application Load Balancer
* Enable logging on ALB and check the logs to see the error being generated
* Use Slow Start Mode when registering the targets to ALB. This assures that the instances get enough time to warm up and hence will not lose the cached data
* Routing configuration of a Load Balancer is used to route traffic to targets. Use this configuration to set the protocol and port number to the correct one

### Question 53:
A hospitality company runs their applications on its on-premises infrastructure but stores the critical customer data on AWS Cloud using AWS Storage Gateway. At a recent audit, the company has been asked if the customer data is secure while in-transit and at rest in the Cloud.
* AWS Storage Gateway uses IPsec to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. All three Gateway types store data in encrypted form at-rest
* AWS Storage Gateway uses SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layers/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. File and Volume Gateway data stored on Amazon S3 is encrypted. Tape Gateway data cannot be encrypted at-rest
* AWS Storage Gateway uses SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layers/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. By default, Storage Gateway uses Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys to server-side encrypt all data it stores in Amazon S3
* AWS Storage Gateway uses IPsec to encrypt data that is transferred between your gateway appliance and AWS storage. File and Volume Gateway data stored on Amazon S3 is encrypted. Tape Gateway data cannot be encrypted at-rest

### Question 54:
An IT services company runs its technology infrastructure on AWS Cloud. The company runs audits for all the development and testing teams against the standards set by the organization.

### Question 57:
The technology team at a startup is looking at moving their technology infrastructure to AWS Cloud. The team has hired you as a SysOps Administrator to help them understand the mechanics of the EC2 instance IP addressing in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
* By default, AWS assigns a public IP address to instances launched in both- default and nondefault VPCs
* An instance can have both - a public IP address and an Elastic IP address with it
* AWS releases your instance's public IP address when it is stopped or terminated. However, the IP address is retained if the instance is hibernated
* You cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address from your instance
* By default, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC use the IPv4 addressing protocol; you can't disable this behavior
* If the public IP address of your instance in a VPC has been released, it will not receive a new one if there is more than one network interface attached to your instance

### Question 58:
As part of regular maintenance, a systems administrator was checking through the configured Auto Scaling groups (ASGs). An error was raised by an Auto Scaling group when attempting to launch an instance that has an encrypted EBS volume. The service-linked role did not have access to the customer-managed CMK used to encrypt the volume.
* Use a CMK in the same AWS account as the Auto Scaling group (ASG). Copy and re-encrypt the snapshot with another CMK that belongs to the same account as the Auto Scaling group. Allow the service-linked role to use the new CMK
* Export the CMK to the ASG account from the instance account. Then, define a role to access this CMK and attach the role to ASG
* Determine which service-linked role to use for this Auto Scaling group. Update the key policy on the CMK and allow the service-linked role to use the CMK. Update the Auto Scaling group to use the service-linked role
* It is not possible for ASGs to initiate EC2 instances that have encrypted volumes attached to them

An organization has multiple AWS accounts to manage different lines of business. A user from the Finance account has to access reports stored in Amazon S3 buckets of two other AWS accounts (belonging to the HR and Audit departments) and copy these reports back to the S3 bucket in the Finance account. The user has requested the necessary permissions from the systems administrator to perform this task.
* Create resource-level permissions in the HR, Audit accounts to allow access to respective S3 buckets for the user in the Finance account
* Create identity-based IAM policy in the Finance account that allows the user to make a request to the S3 buckets in the HR and Audit accounts. Also, create resource-based IAM policies in the HR, Audit accounts that will allow the requester from the Finance account to access the respective S3 buckets
* Create IAM roles in the HR, Audit accounts, which can be assumed by the user from the Finance account when the user needs to access the S3 buckets of the accounts
* Create resource-based policies in the HR, Audit accounts that will allow the requester from the Finance account to access the respective S3 buckets

### Question 60:
A large IT project has multiple teams working on it. The teams share access across the resources - Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets and RDS database.

As a SysOps Administrator, you create and maintain various system configurations for the teams you work with. You have created a CloudFront distribution with origin as an Amazon S3 bucket. The configuration has worked fine so far. However, for a few hours now, an error similar to this has cropped up - The authorization header is malformed; the region '<AWS Region>' is wrong; expecting '<AWS Region>'.
* This error indicates that when CloudFront forwarded a request to the origin, the origin didnâ€™t respond before the request expired. This could be an access issue caused by a firewall or a Security Group not allowing access to CloudFront to access S3 resources
* This error indicates the configured Amazon S3 bucket has been moved from one AWS Region to the other. That is, deleted from one AWS Region and created with the same name in another. To fix this error, update your CloudFront distribution so that it finds the S3 bucket in the bucket's current AWS Region
* This error indicates that the CloudFront distribution and Amazon S3 are not in the same AWS Region. Move one resource so that, both the CloudFront distribution and Amazon S3 are in the same AWS Region
* This error indicates that the API key used for authorization is from an AWS Region that is different from the Region that S3 bucket is created in

### Question 63:
A development team has written configurable scripts that need to be run every day to monitor the business endpoints and APIs. The team wants to integrate these scripts with Amazon CloudWatch service to help in overall monitoring and analysis.

# Exam 3

### Question 1:
A data analytics company uses AWS CloudFormation templates to provision their AWS infrastructure for Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, and Amazon S3 resources. Using cross-stack referencing, a systems administrator creates a stack called NetworkStack which will export the subnetId that can be used when creating EC2 instances in another stack.
* !Sub
* !Ref
* !GetAtt
* !ImportValue

### Question 2:
The technology team at a retail company uses CloudFormation to manage its AWS infrastructure. The team has created a network stack containing a VPC with subnets and a web application stack with EC2 instances and an RDS instance. The team wants to reference the VPC created in the network stack into its web application stack.
* Create a cross-stack reference and use the Outputs output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Ref intrinsic function to reference the value of VPC into the web application stack
* Create a cross-stack reference and use the Export output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value of VPC into the web application stack
* Create a cross-stack reference and use the Export output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Ref intrinsic function to reference the value of VPC into the web application stack
* Create a cross-stack reference and use the Outputs output field to flag the value of VPC from the network stack. Then use Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function to import the value of VPC into the web application stack

### Question 3:
A data analytics company runs its technology operations on AWS Cloud using different VPC configurations for each of its applications. A systems administrator wants to configure the Network Access Control List (ACL) and Security Group (SG) of VPC1 to allow access for AWS resources in VPC2.
* Network ACLs and Security Groups share a parent-child relationship. If resources in VPC2 are given inbound and outbound permissions on Network ACLs of VPC1, the resources will get necessary permissions on the associated security groups too
* The Security Groups of instances on VPC1 should be configured to allow inbound traffic from resources in VPC2. By default, Network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic. So, a default Network ACLs on VPC1 will not need any configuration changes
* Based on the inbound and outbound traffic configurations on Network ACL of VPC1, you can create a similar deny rules on Security Groups of the instances in VPC1 to deny all traffic, other than the one originating from resources in VPC2
* By default, Security Groups allow outbound traffic. Hence, only the inbound traffic configuration of the security groups have to be changed to allow requests from resources in VPC2 to access instances in VPC1. If the subnet is not associated with any Network ACL, you will not need any configuration changes

### Question 4:
A systems administrator has attached two policies to an IAM user. The first policy states that the user has explicitly been denied all access to EC2 instances. The second policy states that the user has been allowed permission for EC2:Describe action.
* The user will get access because it has an explicit allow
* The IAM user stands in an invalid state, because of conflicting policies
* The order of the policy matters. If policy 1 is before 2, then the user is denied access. If policy 2 is before 1, then the user is allowed access
* The user will be denied access because one of the policies has an explicit deny on it

### Question 5:
A developer is tasked with cleaning up obsolete resources. When he tried to delete an AWS CloudFormation stack, the stack deletion process returned without any error or a success message. The stack was not deleted either.
* Some resources must be empty before they can be deleted. Such resources will not be deleted if they are not empty and stack deletion fails without any error
* The AWS user who initiated the stack deletion does not have enough permissions
* Dependent resources should be deleted first, before deleting the rest of the resources in the stack. If this order is not followed, then stack deletion fails without an error
* If you attempt to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the deletion fails and the stack - including its status - remains unchanged

### Question 6:
A multi-national retail company wants to explore a hybrid cloud environment with AWS so that it can start leveraging AWS services for some of its daily workflows. The development team at the company wants to establish a dedicated, encrypted, low latency, and high throughput connection between its data center and AWS Cloud. The team has set aside sufficient time to account for the operational overhead of establishing this connection.
* Use VPC transit gateway to establish a connection between the data center and AWS Cloud

### Question 16:
The development team at an IT company is looking at moving its web applications to Amazon EC2 instances. The team is weighing its options for EBS volumes and instance store-backed instances for these applications with varied workloads.
* Use separate Amazon EBS volumes for the operating system and your data, even though root volume persistence feature is available
* Data stored in the instance store is preserved when you stop or terminate your instance. However, data is lost when you hibernate the instance. Configure EBS volumes or have a backup plan to avoid using critical data to this behavior
* EBS encryption does not support boot volumes
* By default, data on a non-root EBS volume is preserved even if the instance is shutdown or terminated
* Snapshots of EBS volumes, stored on Amazon S3, can be accessed using Amazon S3 APIs
* EBS snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or operating system

### Question 17:

* AWS is responsible for training their customers and their employees as part of Customer Specific training
* AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, for patching the guest Operating Systems and applications of the customers
* For Amazon EC2 service, managing guest operating system (including updates and security patches), application software and Security Groups is the responsibility of the customer
* For Amazon S3 service, managing the operating system and platform is customer responsibility

### Question 36:
A multi-national retail company uses AWS Organizations to manage its users across different divisions. Even though CloudTrail is enabled on the member AWS accounts, managers have noticed that access issues for CloudTrail logs across different divisions and AWS Regions are becoming a bottleneck in troubleshooting issues. They have decided to use the organization trail to keep things simple.
* There is nothing called Organization Trail. The master account can, however, enable CloudTrail logging, to keep track of all activities across AWS accounts
* By default, CloudTrail tracks only bucket-level actions. To track object-level actions, you need to enable Amazon S3 data events
* By default, CloudTrail event log files are not encrypted
* Member accounts do not have access to organization trail, neither do they have access to the Amazon S3 bucket that logs the files
* Member accounts will be able to see the Organization trail, but cannot modify or delete it

### Question 37:
A multi-national company runs its technology infrastructure on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon RDS and Amazon S3 storage.

### Question 38:
A social media company uses Amazon S3 to store the images uploaded by the users. These images are kept encrypted in S3 by using AWS-KMS and the company manages its own Customer Master Key (CMK) for encryption. A systems administrator accidentally deleted the CMK a day ago, thereby rendering the user's photo data unrecoverable. You have been contacted by the company to consult them on possible solutions to this issue.
* The CMK can be recovered by the AWS root account user
* Contact AWS support to retrieve the CMK from their backup
* The company should issue a notification on its web application informing the users about the loss of their data
* As the CMK was deleted a day ago, it must be in the 'pending deletion' status and hence you can just cancel the CMK deletion and recover the key

### Question 39:
A social media company is using AWS CloudFormation to manage its technology infrastructure. It has created a template to provision a stack with a VPC and a subnet. The output value of this subnet has to be used in another stack.

### Question 41:
A retail company has complex AWS VPC architecture that is getting difficult to maintain. The company has decided to configure VPC flow logs to track the network traffic to analyze various traffic flow scenarios. The systems administration team has configured VPC flow logs for one of the VPCs, but it's not able to see any logs. After initial analysis, the team has been able to track the error. It says Access error and the administrator of the team wants to change the IAM Role defined in the flow log definition.
* The flow log is still in the process of being created. It sometimes takes almost 10 minutes to start the logs
* The error indicates that the IAM role does not have a trust relationship with the flow logs service. Change the trust relationship from flow log configuration
* The error indicates an internal error has occurred in the flow logs service. Raise a service request with AWS
* The error indicates IAM role is not correctly configured. After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration. Instead, you need to delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration

### Question 42:
A bug in an application code has resulted in an EC2 instance's CPU utilization touching almost 100 percent thereby freezing the instance. The instance needs a restart to work normally once it hits this point. It will take a few weeks for the team to fix the issue. Till the bug fix is deployed, you have been tasked to automate the instance restart at the first sign of the instance becoming unresponsive.
* Create a CloudWatch alarm for CPU Utilization of the Amazon EC2 instance, with detailed monitoring enabled. Configure an action to restart the instance when the alarm is triggered
* Create a CloudWatch alarm for CPU Utilization of the Amazon EC2 instance, with basic monitoring enabled. Configure an AWS Lambda function against the alarm action. The Lambda function will restart the instance, automating the process
* CPU utilization parameter of an Amazon EC2 instance is a pre-defined metric in CloudWatch and is available in basic monitoring of an instance. Configure the restart action against this metric to automate the instance restart process
* Create a custom code to send CPU utilization of the instance to CloudWatch metrics. Configure an action to restart the instance when the alarm is triggered

### Question 43:
An IT company extensively uses Amazon S3 buckets for storage, hosting, backup and compliance specific replication. A Team Lead has reached out to you for creating a report that lists all the objects that have failed replication in the S3 buckets that the project manages. This process needs to be automated as the Team Lead needs this list daily.
* Use Amazon S3 Inventory reports to list the objects that have failed replication in the S3 buckets
* Use Amazon S3 Storage Lens to report all the objects that failed replication process in the S3 buckets
* Use Amazon S3 Select to list the objects that have failed replication in the S3 buckets
* Configure Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue against the CloudWatch metrics for S3 replication. You can use custom code to aggregate these messages to get the final list of objects that failed replication

### Question 44:
An e-commerce company is running its server infrastructure on Amazon EC2 instance store-backed instances. For better performance, the company has decided to move their applications to another Amazon EC2 instance store-backed instance with a different instance type.
* You can't resize an instance store-backed instance. Instead, you choose a new compatible instance and move your application to the new instance
* Create an image of your instance, and then launch a new instance from this image with the instance type that you need. Any public IP address associated with the instance can be moved with the instance for uninterrupted access of services
* You can't resize an instance store-backed instance. Instead, configure an EBS volume to be the root device for the instance and migrate using the EBS volume
* Create an image of your instance, and then launch a new instance from this image with the instance type that you need. Take any Elastic IP address that you've associated with your original instance and associate it with the new instance for uninterrupted service to your application

An analytics company generates reports for various client applications, some of which have critical data. As per the company's compliance guidelines, data has to be encrypted during data exchange, for all channels of communication. An Amazon S3 bucket is configured as a website endpoint and this is now being added as a custom origin for CloudFront.
* CloudFront always forwards requests to S3 by using the protocol that viewers used to submit the requests. So, we only need to configure CloudFront to mandate the use of HTTPS for users
* Communication between CloudFront and Amazon S3 is always on HTTP protocol since the network used for communication is internal to AWS and is inherently secure
* Configure CloudFront that mandates viewers to use HTTPS to request objects from S3. Configure S3 bucket to support HTTPS communication only. This will force CloudFront to use HTTPS for communication between CloudFront and S3
* Configure CloudFront to mandate viewers to use HTTPS to request objects from S3. However, CloudFront and S3 will use HTTP to communicate with each other

### Question 48:
A healthcare solutions company is undergoing a compliance audit by the regulator. The company has hundreds of IAM users that make API calls but specifically it needs to be determined who is making KMS API calls.
* CloudTrail

### Question 51:
As a SysOps Administrator, you manage a large team of IAM user accounts that are part of multiple AWS accounts. With the growing team size, you have decided to divide IAM users into IAM groups to be able to manage the permissions and policies better.
* An IAM user can belong to multiple IAM groups and an IAM group can be part of another IAM group
* Groups can be given security credentials to be able to access web services directly
* Groups cannot be given security credentials directly, however, these can take up an IAM Role to access web services directly
* Groups can be granted permissions using access control policies
* An IAM user can belong to multiple IAM groups. But, Groups cannot belong to other groups

### Question 52:
A financial services startup is building an interactive tool for personal finance needs. The users would be required to capture their financial data via this tool. As this is sensitive information, the backup of the user data must be kept encrypted in S3.

### Question 57:
A telecommunications company runs its business on AWS Cloud with Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 buckets. Of late, users are complaining of intermittently receiving 500 Internal Error response when accessing the S3 bucket. The team is looking at a way to track the frequency of the error and fix the issue.
* Objects encrypted by AWS KMS are not accessible to users unless permission for KMS key access is provided. Include logic to provide access to KMS keys
* The users accessing the bucket do not have proper permissions to access the objects present in S3. Check the application logic for the IAM Role being assigned when accessing the S3 bucket
* Enable Amazon CloudWatch metrics that include a metric for 5xx server errors. Retrying generally fixes this error
* Check if the S3 bucket has all the objects users are trying to access

### Question 58:
A junior developer is tasked with creating necessary configurations for AWS CloudFormation that is extensively used in a project. After declaring the necessary stack policy, the developer realized that the users still do not have access to stack resources. The stack policy created by the developer looks like so:
* The stack policy is invalid and hence the users are not granted any permissions. The developer needs to fix the syntactical errors in the policy
* A stack policy applies only during stack updates, it doesn't provide access controls. The developer needs to provide access through IAM policies
* Stack policies are associated with a particular IAM role or an IAM user. Hence, they only work for the users you have explicitly attached the policy to
* Stack policies do not allow wildcard character value (*) for the Principal element of the policy

### Question 59:

* Look at the X-Forwarded-For header
* Modify the front-end of the website so that the users send their IP in the requests
* Look at the client's cookie
* Look at the X-Forwarded-Proto header

### Question 61:
A startup uses Amazon S3 buckets for storing their customer data. The company has defined different retention periods for different objects present in their Amazon S3 buckets, based on the compliance requirements. But, the retention rules do not seem to work as expected.
* You cannot place a retention period on an object version through a bucket default setting
* Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and periods
* When you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version
* When you use bucket default settings, you specify a Retain Until Date for the object version
* The bucket default settings will override any explicit retention mode or period you request on an object version

### Question 62:
An organization that started as a single AWS account, gradually moved to a multi-account setup. The organization also has multiple AWS environments in each account, that were being managed at the account level. Backups are a big part of this management task. The organization is looking at moving to a centralized backup management process that consolidates and automates Cross-Region backup tasks across AWS accounts.
* Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to manage creation, deletion, and managing of all the AWS resources under an account. Tag all the resources that need to be backed up and use lifecycle policies to customize the backup management to cater to the needs of the organization
* Use Amazon EventBridge to create a workflow for scheduled backup of all AWS resources under an account. Amazon S3 lifecycle policies, Amazon EC2 instance backups, and Amazon RDS backups can be used to create the events for the EventBridge. The same workflow can be scheduled to work on production and non-production environments, based on the tags created
* Configure AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to schedule backup tasks as per company's policies. Tag the resources to help identify them by the AWS environment they run in. Amazon CloudWatch dashboards hosted by Systems Manager to get an overall view of the status of all resources under the AWS account
* Create a backup plan in AWS Backup. Assign tags to resources based on the environment ( Production, Development, Testing). Create one backup policy for production environments and one backup policy for non-production environments. Schedule the backup plan based on the organization's backup policies
